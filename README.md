Fun little app where you match with users with similar book tastes!

## Project Idea
As an former librarian, recommending books was one of my favorite parts of the job. I knew I wanted to build a book app and that's where I thought of book tinder. It's not meant to be a dating app, more of a... "hey! that person has similar tastes, let me see what else they enjoyed so I can read it" app. I hope this encourages more people to read. :3 

## Project Goal
"Rails is omakaze"
I specifically chose to work on Ruby and Rails because of its doctrine(https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine). Using a stack that has been preassembled, will help me understand proper routings while also letting me spend more time on functionality. :)  I will be using ruby on rails screencast, blogs, documentation, and other lifelines to help me through this.  ~~I will also add testing~~

## post project reflections

VERSION ISSUES:
I normally work on my PC but I had to go someplace so I took my mac. When I tried to work on the mac it wouldnt work so I updated and did something(forgot) to make it work.  And then, I went back on my PC and again had the same issue!  I was baffled and couldn't do anything for a little bit. The fix was I changed the gemfile and put in the working ruby version of each computer. 

THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX:
Because our last project was on react, I kept trying to fit rails into react like a puzzle and it wasn't connecting. My friend made a diagram for me about how react and rails work differently.

I had many goals for this project but learning a new framework and trying to remember ruby was a challenge. I practiced making rail's hello-world equivalent app, the blog  app https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html. I thought it would a simple code along but because the structure was so different, making it once took a very long time! Overall, I really enjoyed ruby and rails. I loved the structure of rails, and when I needed help and I googled... I would find issues that were repeated and uniformed solutions!
